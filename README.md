# Business Database App

## Description
This app is based on the idea of the Content Management System, an interface that allows users to interact with databases without using a coding language.  To do this, the app is created using Inquirer combined with MySQL2, to allow a user to utilise a database via input prompting.  This app presents prompts through a command line interface for managing a practice company's business database.
