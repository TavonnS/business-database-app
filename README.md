# Business Database App

## Description
This app is based on the idea of the Content Management System, an interface that allows users to interact with databases without writing code directly.  To do this, the app is created using Inquirer combined with MySQL2, to allow a user to utilise a database via input prompting.  This app presents prompts through a command line interface for managing a practice company's business database.
